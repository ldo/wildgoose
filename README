This is an experiment in plausible-deniability encryption.

   >**WARNING**: This actual implemention is **not secure enough** for production use.
   There are very likely a hundred different ways to attack the program that do not
   involve the strength or otherwise of the mathematical theory itself. What I want
   to determine is whether the theory works or not. If it doesn’t, then bugs in
   the code don’t matter anyway.

With all the encryption algorithms I’ve been aware of up to now, you very quickly
discover whether you entered the right key during the decryption step.

But what if you had an algorithm where, if you entered the wrong key, it might
not immediately reveal the fact? Instead it would simply keep processing without
terminating.

I’m not talking about an obfuscated implementation of an algorithm that wastes its
time in pointless loops: such a thing can be discovered by an attacker, who can
patch their copy of the decryption code to bypass such nonsense. No, I’m talking
about designing such time-wasting into the algorithm itself, so that there is no
way to shortcut the process.

What are the uses for such an algorithm? Clearly, the value lies in assuming
that the attacker can get hold of the correct key, but that it is hidden among
a large number (perhaps thousands or more) of decoy keys, so that they cannot easily
determine which key to try.

Some Governments have passed laws requiring users to turn over decryption keys
on demand. With an algorithm like this, the decryption key could be “hidden in
plain sight” as it were; when the user’s machine or media are confiscated, could
they get away with claiming that the necessary key is already in the possession
of the Government authority doing the confiscation?

Even if the law is specific enough to require that the user point to the exact
key to use, they can still pick a wrong one, and claim that the decryption
will take a very long time. For added value, they can decide, after a suitably
lengthy interval, that perhaps that was the wrong key after all, and pick another
(wrong) key, and repeat the time-wasting process.

With sufficient resources, of course the attacker could simply try all the keys
in parallel; as soon as the correct decryption completes, all the attempts with
decoy keys can be abandoned. Thus, there needs to a sufficient number of decoys
to render this strategy impractical. If even decryption with the correct key takes
a significant amount of time (say, a few seconds), then the number of decoy keys
need not be so great.

The particular encryption algorithm defined here is based on the [Collatz
recurrence relation](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CollatzProblem.html). Each
starting positive integer value produces a sequence of positive integers that
end with 1. While the lengths of sequences can vary unpredictably, all sequences
seems to be finite in length, though this has not been proven.

It should be possible to concoct similar algorithms based on other equally
hard-to-predict recurrence relations, such as the
[logistic map](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LogisticMap.html) in its chaotic
regime, or the formula that defines the
[Mandelbrot set](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MandelbrotSet.html).

The algorithm is a secret-key algorithm (as opposed to a public/private-key
algorithm like RSA): the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
The key is a large random positive integer N. The user encrypting the data also chooses
a positive integer parameter K which governs the amount of processing required
to perform the encryption and decryption: larger K takes more time.

The procedure is as follows: the sequence of integers N, N + 1 ... is used,
each in turn as input to the Collatz formula; for each sequence of integers
output from the formula, the even ones are discarded, and the odd ones are used in
turn TBD. The process stops when K Collatz output integers have been used.

TBD how to cleanly reverse process for decryption? Or make transformation performed
using these integers symmetrical, so it can be performed in either order? But that
might weaken the encryption.

(The choice of odd integers only is done to make the sequence less predictable,
since odd integers never occur in succession in a Collatz “hailstone” sequence,
whereas even ones do.)

Decryption requires only the key N. The sequence of integers N, N + 1 ... is
generated as before, and each integer generated by the Collatz relation is
used in turn until the hash comes out correct. At this point we know we have a
a correct decryption.

The value K should probably not be recorded anywhere (not even in the user’s memory),
since it can serve as a clue to the attacker.

If the wrong value of N is used, the decryption algorithm will (we assume) keep
running for an infeasibly large amount of time without producing a meaningful result.
The attacker cannot reliably tell when to stop it, since the user may indeed have chosen a
very large value of K. All they can do is take a guess after some arbitrary amount
of time that the value of N being tried is probably wrong.
